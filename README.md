# InfectionSim

This framework is intended to enable the modelling of discrete time agent-based stochastic infection dynamics in an urban environment, where agents take actions according to a discrete time Markov (geometric dwell times) or semi-Markov (non-geometric dwell times) process. There are three classes of agent implemented: human, pathogen, and bug for simulation of generic vector-borne pathogens.
